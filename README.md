# CMPDL

**Curse Modpack Downloader**

This version is a fixed version of the original that works in 2023.

Downloads modpacks from Curse, given a URL and Curse File ID. Experimental. Requires gson (2.8.x) and zip4j (1.3.2).

The original was licensed under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/); I will consider this one to too.

## Usage Instructions (from original)
 
 * Download CMPDL on the [Releases](https://github.com/Vazkii/CMPDL/releases) page. Run it.
 * Find the pack you want. We'll use [Proton](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/proton) as an example.
 * Copy the URL of the project home on CurseForge. It should look like the one on the last point. Paste this URL on the "Modpack URL" field on CMPDL. (you can also choose a local modpack zip file)
 * Specify a version of the modpack, enter that version in the "Curse File ID" field. You can find the ID at the end of the urls under "Recent Files" in the sidebar on the project page or in the project's "Files" tab.
 * Press Download and wait.
 * Copy your modpack files over to wherever you want them.
